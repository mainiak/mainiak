# About me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @mainiak
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Kubernetes, OCI/Docker, Linux, IaaS, IaaC, SaaS, FaaS, IPLD and IPFS, full-stack programming, Cryptography, AWS, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things, and still learning more about what I looked into before - ie. Go, Vue, React, Redis, Kubernetes, ...
- 💞️ I’m NOT currently looking to collaborate on any projects, but might in future (Go, Dart, ...). Hopefully I can publish something of my own.
- 📫 You can reach me via DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mainiak_cz) in English 🇬🇧 or Czech 🇨🇿
